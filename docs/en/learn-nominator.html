<p>You may have an account with DOT and want to earn fresh DOT. You could do so as validator, which
requires a node running 24/7. If you do not have such node or do not want to bother, you can still
earn DOT by nominating another validator.</p>
<p>By doing so, you become a nominator for the validator(s) of your choice. Pick your validators
carefully - if they do not behave properly, they will get slashed and you will lose DOT as well.</p>
<p>While your DOT are staked by nominating a validator, they are 'locked' (bonded). You can receive new
DOT in your account but you cannot stake as validator or transfer DOT away from your account. You
can <a href="maintain-guides-how-to-unbond">un-nominate at any time</a> to stop staking your funds. Keep in
mind that the un-nomination is effective in the next era, and that un-nominating does not
automatically unbond your funds. There is an unbonding period of 7 days on Kusama and 28 days on
Polkadot before bonded funds can be transferred.</p>

<p>When you go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/actions">Account actions</a> under staking
page, you should see your bonded accounts and nomination status. If not, you can follow
<a href="maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-kusama">this</a> guide to configure it first. Your nominations will be
effective in the next era, that means roughly 6 hours on Kusama and 24 hours on Polkadot.</p>
<p><img src="/img/staking/polkadotjs_nominator_account.png" alt="Nominations"></p>
<p>Suppose you have nominated five validator candidates, and three out of five were elected to the
active validator set, then you should see two of your nominations as &quot;waiting&quot;, and most likely one
as &quot;active&quot; and the rest as &quot;inactive&quot;. Active or inactive nomination means your nominated
validators have been elected to be in the validator set, whereas waiting means they did not get
elected. Generally, you will only have a single validator have an active nomination, which means
that you are directly supporting it with your stake this era and thus potentially receiving staking
rewards. Every era, a new election will take place and you may have be assigned a different active
nomination from among the validators you have selected.</p>
<p>If you are committing a very large amount of stake, then you may have more than one active
nomination. However, the election algorithm attempts to minimize this situation, and it should not
occur often. See the <a href="learn-phragmen#optimizations">section on Phragmén optimization</a> for more
details.</p>

<p>Validators can only pay out to a certain number of nominators per era. This is currently set to
{{ polkadot_max_nominators }}, but can be modified via governance. If more than
{{ polkadot_max_nominators }} nominators nominate the same validator, it is &quot;oversubscribed&quot;, and
only the top {{ polkadot_max_nominators }} staked nominators (ranked by amount of stake) are paid
rewards. Other nominators will receive no rewards for that era, although their stake will still be
used to calculate entry into the active validator set.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to determine exactly how many nominators will nominate a given validator in
the next era, one can estimate based on the current number of nominators. A nominator with only 5
nominators in this era, for instance, is unlikely to have more than {{ polkadot_max_nominators }} in
the next era. An already-oversubscribed validator with 1000 nominators this era, however, is much
more likely to be oversubscribed in the next era as well.</p>

<p>As long as you have nominated more than one validator candidate and at least one of them got
elected, your bonded stake will be fully distributed to one or more validators. That being said, you
still will have the chance to get 0 rewards if you nominated very few validator candidates and no
one got elected, or your stake is small and you only selected oversubscribed validators. It is
generally wise to choose as many trustworthy validators as you can (up to 16) to reduce the risk of
none of your nominated validators being elected.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind as a nominator is the validator's commission. The commission is the
percentage of the validator reward which is taken by the validator before the rewards are split
among the nominators. As a nominator you may think that the lowest commission is best. However, this
is not always true. Validators must be able to run at break-even in order to sustainably continue
operation. Independent validators that rely on the commission to cover their server costs help to
keep the network decentralized. Commission is just one piece of the puzzle that you should consider
when picking validators to nominate.</p>
<p><img src="/img/staking/polkadotjs_nominators_target.png" alt="Staking Returns"></p>
<p>As a nominator, if you only want to know the profit each validator made for each era, you can go to
the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets">Targets</a> section under the staking page by
inputting the number of tokens you would like to stake to check it. Then, nominate those who have a
higher profit. However, that does not guarantee the right way to evaluate the validators' overall
performance.</p>

<p>On the Targets page, you can filter out validators that have traits that may indicate an issue with
you nominating them. You can turn these filters off and on to help narrow down which validators you
should nominate. It is important to note that none of these traits are necessarily &quot;bad&quot;; however,
depending on your validator selection methodology, they may be characteristics that you would be
interested in filtering out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single from operator</strong> - Do not show groups of validators run by a single operator.</li>
<li><strong>No 20%+ comm</strong> - Do not show any validators with a commission of 20% or higher.</li>
<li><strong>No at capacity</strong> - Do not show any validators who are currently operating
<a href="glossary#capacity">at capacity</a> (i.e., could potentially be oversubscribed).</li>
<li><strong>Recent payouts</strong> - Only show validators that have recently caused a
<a href="learn-simple-payouts">payout to be issued</a>. Note that anyone can cause a payout to occur; it does
not have to be the operator of a validator.</li>
<li><strong>Only elected</strong> - Only show validators that are currently in the active set (i.e., they have been
elected to produce blocks this era).</li>
<li><strong>Only with an identity</strong> - Only show validators that have set an <a href="learn-identity">identity</a>. Note
that this identity does not have to be verified by a registrar for the validator to show up in the

<p>How the validator acted in the past may be a good indicator of how they will act in the future. An
example of problematic behavior would be if a validator is regularly offline, their nominators most
likely would get fewer rewards than others. More importantly, when many validators are
<a href="learn-staking#unresponsiveness">unreachable</a>, those nominators who staked with them will be
slashed.</p>
<p><img src="/img/staking/polkadotjs_validator_stats.png" alt="Validator Stats"></p>
<p>Thus, to be a smart nominator, it would be better to query their
<a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/query/">histories</a> to see statistics such as blocks
produced, rewards and slashes, and <a href="learn-identity">identity</a> (if they have it set). Moreover, a
nominator should do comprehensive research on their validator candidates - they should go over the
validators' websites to see who they are, what kind of infrastructure setup they are using,
reputation, the vision behind the validator, and more.</p>

<p>Recall that slashing is an additive function; the more validators that are offline or equivocate in
a given session, the harsher the penalties. Since validators that are controlled by a single entity
are more at risk of a &quot;synchronized&quot; failure, nominating them implies a greater risk of having a
large slash of your nominated funds. Generally, it is safer to nominate validators whose behavior is
independent from others in as many ways as possible (different hardware, geographic location, owner,
etc.).</p>

<p>If you are not nominating with a large number of DOTs, you should try to avoid
<a href="glossary#oversubscribed">oversubscribed</a> validators. It is not always easy to calculate if the
validator selected will be oversubscribed in the next session; one way to avoid choosing potentially
oversubscribed validators is to filter out any that are <a href="glossary#capacity">at capacity</a> on the
Targets page.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have a very small amount of DOTs, you may not be able to have your nomination fit
into the election set. The nominator to validator mapping has to fit in a single block, and if there
are too many nominators, the lowest-staked nominations will be dropped. This value is obviously
dynamic and will vary over time. If you review the lowest amount of nominations that are occurring
on current validators, you can get a good idea of how many DOTs will likely be necessary to have
your nomination earn you rewards. You can read the blog post
